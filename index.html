            In other words, web developers are programmers who specialize in the development of web applications and interfaces. Many web developers also double as web designers, which means they don't only bring websites to life, but also build the architecture, including visual design and layouts – however, if web design isn't something you're interested in, you don't have to offer these services.

        <p>
            As the Web has grown more complex and as more becomes possible on the Internet, developers have gotten more specialized. That means that web development now means a lot of different things depending on what a web developer specializes in. Here are the three main categories:
            
            front end development (the visible parts of a website or app)
            back end development (the “under the hood” databases and infrastructure)
            full stack development (a hybrid of both). Full stack can apply to a web stack, mobile stack, or a native application stack (i.e. software programs for specific devices)</p>
